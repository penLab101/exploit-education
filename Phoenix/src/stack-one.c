 * This level looks at the concept of modifying variables to specific values in
 * the program, and how the variables are laid out in memory.
 *
 * Hints:
 * - man ascii can tell you what the hexadecimal characters are.
 * - Having troubles? How does the endianness of the architecture affect the
 *   layout of how variables are laid out?
 *
 * The aim is to change the contents of the changeme variable to 0x496c5962
 *
 * Did you hear about the kid napping at the local school?
 * It's okay, they woke up.
