 * phoenix/stack-four, by https://exploit.education
 *
 * Stack Four takes a look at what can happen when you can overwrite the saved
 * instruction pointer (standard buffer overflow).
 *
 * Hints:
 * - The saved instruction pointer is not necessarily directly after the end of
 *   variable allocations – things like compiler padding can increase the size.
 *   Did you know that some architectures may not save the return address on
 *   the stack in all cases?
 * - GDB supports “run < my_file” to direct input from my_file into the program.
 *
 * The aim is to execute the function complete_level by modifying the
 * saved return address, and pointing it to the complete_level() function.
 *
 * Why were the apple and orange all alone? Because the bananna split.
